# Better Anecdotes Application (Exercises 6.14 - 6.15)

This project is an extension of the Better Anecdotes application, now integrating a backend using `json-server` to manage anecdote data.

## Exercises Overview

### 6.14 Anecdotes and the Backend, step 1
- On application launch, the anecdotes are fetched from a backend implemented using `json-server`.
- The initial backend data is stored in a file named `anecdotes.json` with the following content:
  ```json
  {
    "anecdotes": [
      {
        "content": "If it hurts, do it more often",
        "id": "47145",
        "votes": 0
      },
      {
        "content": "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later!",
        "id": "21149",

      },
      {
        "content": "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 10 percent of the development time...The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.",

      {

      {
